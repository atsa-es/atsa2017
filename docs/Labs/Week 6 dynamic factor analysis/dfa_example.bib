@article{lisi2015,
	Abstract = {How local geomorphic and hydrologic features mediate the sensitivity of stream thermal regimes to variation in climatic conditions remains a critical uncertainty in understanding aquatic ecosystem responses to climate change. We used stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to estimate contributions of snow and rainfall to 80 boreal streams and show that differences in snow contribution are controlled by watershed topography. Time series analysis of stream thermal regimes revealed that streams in rain-dominated, low-elevation watersheds were 5-8 times more sensitive to variation in summer air temperature compared to streams draining steeper topography whose flows were dominated by snowmelt. This effect was more pronounced across the landscape in early summer and less distinct in late summer. Thus, the impact of climate warming on freshwater thermal regimes will be spatially heterogeneous across river basins as controlled by geomorphic features. However, thermal heterogeneity may be lost with reduced snowpack and increased ratios of rain to snow in stream discharge.},

@article{stachura2014,
	Abstract = {We identified three dominant patterns of temporal variation (1951-2002) in the abundance of 34 stock groups of wild North American and Asian pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that were related to patterns of oceanographic variability. We identified these patterns using three different ordination methods and found consistent patterns across these methods. Alaskan salmon dominated the most prominent pattern, which exhibited a positive abundance shift in the mid-1970s. In general, warm (cold) periods in the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea corresponded with high (low) abundance years for these stock groups. The second abundance pattern captured differences among Asian, northern North American, and southern North American population groups and was associated with an intense, large-scale Aleutian Low. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis that identifies regional patterns of covariation in salmon abundance around the entire North Pacific Rim, and it highlights the existence of basin-wide covariations in wild salmon abundance that are associated with spatially coherent and regionally distinct patterns in North Pacific climate.},

	Abstract = {This article discusses dynamic factor analysis, a technique for estimating common trends in multivariate time series. Unlike more common time series techniques such as spectral analysis and ARIMA models, dynamic factor analysis can analyse short, non-stationary time series containing missing values. Typically, the parameters in dynamic factor analysis are estimated by direct optimization, which means that only small data sets can be analysed if computing time is not to become prohibitively long and the chances of obtaining sub-optimal estimates are to be avoided. This article shows how the parameters of dynamic factor analysis can be estimated using the EM algorithm, allowing larger data sets to be analysed. The technique is illustrated on a marine environmental data set. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is a technique used to detect common patterns in a set of time series and relationships between these series and explanatory variables. Although DFA is used widely in econometric and psychological fields, it has not been used in fisheries and aquatic sciences to the best of our knowledge. To make the technique more widely accessible, an introductory guide for DFA, at an intermediate level, is presented in this paper. A case study is presented. The analysis of 13 landings-per-unit-effort series for Nephrops around northern Europe identified three common trends for 12 of the series, with one series being poorly fitted, but no relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or sea surface temperature were found. The 12 series could be divided into six groups based on factor loadings from the three trends.},
